//! Hazard pointer management.
//!
//! "Hazard" is the general name for an atomic pointer potentially "protecting" some object from
//! getting deleted. First when the hazard is changed to another state, the object can be deleted.
//!
//! Since hazards are only useful when they're shared between the global and local state, a "hazard
//! pair" refers to the collection of the two connected ends of the hazard (they both share a
//! pointer to the hazard on the heap). When such pair is created, its reading end is usually
//! stored in the global state, such that a thread can check that no hazard is matching a
//! particular object during garbage collection. The writer part controls what the state of the
//! hazard is and is usually passed around locally.
//!
//! The asymmetry of a hazard pair is strictly speaking not necessary, but it allows to enforce
//! rules (e.g. only the reader/global part may deallocate the hazard box).
