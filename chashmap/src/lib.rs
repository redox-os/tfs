//! Concurrent hash maps.
//!
//! This crate implements concurrent hash maps, based on bucket-level multi-reader locks. It has
//! excellent performance characteristics¹ and supports resizing, in-place mutation and more.
//!
//! The API derives directly from `std::collections::HashMap`, giving it a familiar feel.
//!
//! ¹Note that it heavily depends on the behavior of your program, but in most cases, it's really
//!  good. In some (rare) cases you might want atomic hash maps instead.
//!
//! # How it works
//!
//! `chashmap` is not lockless, but it distributes locks across the map such that lock contentions
//! (which is what could make accesses expensive) are very rare.
//!
//! Hash maps consists of so called "buckets", which each defines a potential entry in the table.
//! The bucket of some key-value pair is determined by the hash of the key. By holding a read-write
//! lock for each bucket, we ensure that you will generally be able to insert, read, modify, etc.
//! with only one or two locking subroutines.
//!
//! There is a special-case: reallocation. When the table is filled up such that very few buckets
//! are free (note that this is "very few" and not "no", since the load factor shouldn't get too
//! high as it hurts performance), a global lock is obtained while rehashing the table. This is
//! pretty inefficient, but it rarely happens, and due to the adaptive nature of the capacity, it
//! will only happen a few times when the map has just been initialized.
//!
//! ## Collision resolution
//!
//! When two hashes collide, they cannot share the same bucket, so there must be an algorithm which
//! can resolve collisions. In our case, we use linear probing, which means that we take the bucket
//! following it, and repeat until we find a free bucket.
//!
//! This method is far from ideal, but superior methods like Robin-Hood hashing works poorly (if at
//! all) in a concurrent structure.
//!
//! # The API
//!
//! The API should feel very familiar, if you are used to the libstd hash map implementation. They
//! share many of the methods, and I've carefully made sure that all the items, which have similarly
//! named items in libstd, matches in semantics and behavior.
