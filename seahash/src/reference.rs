//! A slow, but clear reference implementation of SeaHash.
//!
//! # Specification
//!
//! The input buffer is padded with null bytes until the length is divisible by 8.
//!
//! We start out with state
//!
//! ```notest
//! a = 0x16f11fe89b0d677c
//! b = 0xb480a793d8e6c86c
//! c = 0x6fe2e5aaf078ebc9
//! d = 0x14f994a4c5259381
//! ```
//!
//! If a seed is given, each of the initial state component are modularly multiplied by the seed.
//!
//! From the stream, we read one 64-bit block (in little-endian) at a time.  This number, `n`,
//! determines the new state by:
//!
//! ```notest
//! a' = b
//! b' = c
//! c' = d
//! d  = g(a ⊕ n)
//! ```
//!
//! `g(x)` is defined as `g(x) = j(h(j(x)))` with `h(x) = (x ≫ 32) ≫ (x ≫ 60)` and `j(x) ≡ px (mod
//! 2^64)` with `p = 0x7ed0e9fa0d94a33`.
//!
//! Let the final state be `(x, y, z, w)`. Then the final result is given by `H = g(x ⊕ y ⊕ z ⊕ w ⊕
//! l)` where `l` is the number of bytes in the original buffer.
